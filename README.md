# Zazuko SHACL Playground

Our SHACL playground allows you to define Data Shapes according to the [Shapes Constraint Language (SHACL)](https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/) and test them against sample data.

This is possible in an interactive, client-only environment. An instance is available at https://zazuko.github.io/shacl-playground/

It is built on our JavaScript based [SHACL library](https://github.com/zazuko/rdf-validate-shacl).
